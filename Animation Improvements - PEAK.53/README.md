# Animation Improvements - PEAK.53

I was hired by the PEAK.53 team to implement new mocap animations, create new blend spaces, and make some improvements to the IK and animation blueprints. I also implemented a system which raises the player's gun when enemies are nearby. Here are some clips of how the animations looked before and after my changes.
