# Fight Scene Remake

I used Sequencer (cinematic tool in Unreal Engine 4) to remake a Fight Scene created by Epic Games. The original video can be found here: https://youtu.be/EO0k92iVMjE

The work mainly consisted of creating new camera angles and modifying lighting, animation and sound. I also spent many hours trying to find solutions for things that didn’t work at all or at least didn’t work as intended in Sequencer and UE4's other tools, e.g. the buggy relationship between Sequencer and the skeletal animation tools. Nonetheless, working on this was mostly fun and I learned a lot about cinematics in UE4.
