# BEAM - Project Prototype

My first attempt at creating a multiplayer system in Unreal Engine 4 from scratch. Available for download here: https://loyalroyal.itch.io/beam

I have built a lot of respect for people building multiplayer projects while working on this. What's relatively easy to build in single player games becomes a real challenge to translate into a multiplayer experience. For example, things as simple as copying character arm movements (up/down) took me quite a while to figure out.

My main focus here was to make a functioning multiplayer game, and obviously there need to be many more improvements for this game to be all-round functioning and enjoyable. If I decide to continue its development, these are some of the things I'd like to implement:
- better hit detection
- scoring system
- fully functioning menu
- proper gameplay arena

This project is based on the first-person shooter example project from UE4. The animations are from the animation starter pack. The sounds are from https://www.zapsplat.com/

The rest is my work.
