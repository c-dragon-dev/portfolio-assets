# Expedition Zero Immersion

I was asked to improve the immersion and overall "feel" of Expedition Zero - a horror survival game by Enigmatic Machines.

My work here mainly consisted of implementing screen effects, camera movements/shakes and provided sound effects to convey the misery the character is going through - cold, violence, poison gas, you name it.

I've used Chameleon Post Process to implement many of the effects.

Cold effects: frost and shivering. The character also breathes a sigh of relief when the temperature reaches a comfortable level (hard to hear due to the storm)

Head movement added through camera shakes to make the rifle more satisfying to shoot

Walking and sprinting head movement. Notice the up-and-down motion when the player is breathing heavily. Head bob amount can be adjusted or disabled in settings

Noise effects when a monster is near

I've worked on the monster's tongue attack throwing motion to make it feel more impactful

There's a chance of the visor cracking when getting hit
